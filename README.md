### Willkommen, Bienvenue, Welcome!

I'm Robert Grimm and this here is where you find some of the code I wrote as of late.
If you want to learn more about me, my professional background in computing, as well as
some of my other interests, I encourage you to click on over to my personal website at
[apparebit.com](https://apparebit.com).

Then again, you can find the
[source code for said website](https://github.com/apparebit/apparebit.com) right around
here. That also holds for the
[static website generator](https://github.com/apparebit/siteforge) I've been developing
to help me build the website.

Alas, the website generator project also serves as personal software playground. That
may just explain the current paucity of content on the website. But as my user and
website name _apparebit_ so assuredly states in Latin: _It will appear_! ðŸ™„
